# HUNDRED-YEAR FARMS

The name Hundred-Year Farms refers to two small farm properties (each about 43 acres); one on Prince Edward Island and the other in Manitoba. Our long-term plan for the island farm is to gradually transition to Agroforestry. Agroforesty involves the planting of varied crops, including grains, fruits, or vegetables, among rows of trees. Crop acreage on the farm will not change, however, through these changes food production, habitat, soil, and water quality, when measured as a whole, should be able to remain steady, or possibly even improve, as the climate changes. While the transition to agroforestry will require a significant investment, we believe that it will also make the farm more interesting, more enjoyable to visit, and more likely to remain profitable over the next 100 years.

## Farm Practice

There are five basic types of agroforestry practices today in North America: windbreaks, alley cropping, silvopasture, riparian buffers, and forest farming. Alley cropping, which will be the method used on this farm, is the cultivation of crops between rows of trees.

At this farm, strong wind-break trees will be planted along the upper-most ridges with the trees and crops that require more sunlight, warmth, and wind protection located progressively lower on the farm's south sloping land. The existing trees are a near mono-crop of spruce resulting from prior a clear-cut, but the new trees will be a diverse mix that may include maple, oak, poplar, birch, hemlock, and apple, among others.  The trees in rows will be arranged to allow for selective harvesting while some blocks will be left to grow unmanaged. Similiar to the trees, the crops that will be planted between the rows of trees will also be more diverse than in the past.  Some reasons for the planned transition to agroforestry are listed below:

- Diversify farm income: Higher value wood, fruit, or nuts can be harvested along with vegetables and grains.
  
- Productivity: Many plants grow better when provided with long days (south slope), but diffused light from tree shade in mid-afternoon. Trees also reduce wind speed and create micro-climates that can further improve crop yield and quality.
  
- Biodiversity: A diverse mix of plants and wildlife can be effective in the control of pests, disease, and fire risk while making the property more interesting to live on or visit, thereby increasing value of the underlying asset.

A - water erosion down the centre of this field is already evident, but can be controlled by the new rows of trees that follow field contours. B - this prior clear-cut, which is now a near mono-crop of spruce trees, will be diversified to a range of native tree species. C - there will be relatively little change to this field apart from re-aligning the existing windbreak so it follows natural contours and then adding a second row at the lowest and steepest part of the field. D - Owner's home.  The proposed changes will be gradual and may take decades to complete.*

## Management

The owners plan to develop these methods for managing their agroforesty practice.

**BIM (Building Information Management)**

Building Information Management (BIM) tools are being used for design of the farm and its buildings, but with the eventual goal of using it to manage the farm's asset data over time (e.g. trees, soil conditions, crop yields, buildings, infrastructure, ...) . While often associated with the design of buildings, industry is expanding the underlying BIM file system ([IFC5](https://www.buildingsmart.org/ifc-for-site-landscape-and-urban-planning-call-for-participation/)) to include infrastructure and landscaping, making it relevant to agroforestry (especially where IFC is used by local government for the surrounding civil works). Apart from farm management, this 3D file system should prove useful to researchers studying, or modelling the performance of, agroforestry systems.  The intent is to eventually add the workflow and the model to this git repository.

**Cogeneration of heat and power with carbon sinking**

By their nature, active small farms can produce a lot of waste biomass that must be managed. Through gassification this debris can be used to produce heat (e.g. for greenhouses), electricity, and with some designs, solid carbon as either a soil ammendment or product. Carbon-sinking agroforestry could be used to offset the carbon released by agri-business, thus improving small farm economics while making the agricultural sector, as a whole, more carbon neutral.

**Co-operatives**: Farming co-operatives were common on the Canadian prarie, for everything from grain elevators to the manufacture of farm equipment, up to about the 1970s. While that is no longer the case, smart contracts (e.g. Ethereum), and the other new technologies that are now reorganizing supply chains, could once again make co-operatives competitive in certain areas and help restore what had been an important means of farm and community development. This is a topic of ongoing study.

## Owners

Nancy and Brenon Knaggs both grew up on small farms. During their working careers Nancy helped manage new technology product development. Brenon worked in the engineering design of cogeneration power systems and later municipal works. They both have a keen interest in the relation between small farms, communities, and biodiversity within a time of changing climate and technology.
